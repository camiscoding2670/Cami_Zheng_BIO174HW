    "1. Choose your country.\n",
    "2. Get only the cities of that country from the `world_cities.csv` file.\n",
    "3. Sort the cities by population and select the 20 to 50 most populated cities.\n",
    "4. Create a data frame with only these cities.\n",
    "5. Calculate the distance between the cities using their latitude/longitude data from your data frame (geopy).\n",
    "6. Create a data frame with a table of all the distances between each paur of cities. This needs to be in a distance matrix format, just like we imported from the `cities.csv` file for the US.\n",
    "7. Perform the PCoA using skbio.\n",
    "8. Plot the results of the PCoA using plotly express.\n",
